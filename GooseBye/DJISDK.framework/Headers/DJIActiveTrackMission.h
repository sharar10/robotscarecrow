/**
 *  ActiveTrack Mission allows an aircraft to track a moving subject using the
 *  vision system and without a GPS tracker on the subject. To use an
 *  ActiveTrack mission:
 *      - prepareMission with the rectangle that best represents the target to
 *        track
 *      - startMission to initiate tracking of the object and begin the state
 *        updates (DJIMissionProgressStatus)
 *      - At this point, the aircraft will track the target while hovering in
 *        place.
 *      - Give confirmation that the tracked target is correct with
 *        `acceptConfirmationWithCompletion` and the aircraft will begin flying
 *        relative to the target.
 *      - If the tracking algorithm looses sufficient confidence in tracking the
 *        target, then the aircraft will stop flying relative to the object and
 *        either notify the user (through execution state) that the target is
 *        lost or it needs another confirmation that the target is correct.
 *      - If the mission is paused, the aircraft will hover in place, but
 *        continue tracking the target by adjusting gimbal pitch and aircraft yaw.
 *      - If mission is resumed, confirmation of tracking rectangle will need to
 *        be sent through to start flying relative to target.
 *      - Mission can be canceled with stopMission at any time, or with
 *        `rejectConfirmationWithCompletion` if confirmation of tracking
 *        rectangle is being asked.
 *      - The main camera is used to track the target, so gimbal cannot be
 *        adjusted during an ActiveTrack mission.
 *      - During the mission the aircraft can be manually flown with pitch, roll
 *        and throttle. Yaw and gimbal are automatically controlled to continue
 *        tracking the target.
 *      - If the mission is executing, and after confirmation of the tracking
 *        rectangle has been sent, the aircraft can be manually controlled
 *        horizontally similar to a DJIFlightOrientationModeHomeLock where the
 *        `home` is the tracked target. If aircraft is manually controlled
 *        upward, the aircraft will lift and retreat, and if it is controlled
 *        downward, it will go down and get closer to the target.
